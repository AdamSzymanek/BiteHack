# 🛒 Local Business - E-commerce Platform

## 💡 Project Idea

**Local Business** is a modern e-commerce platform designed to support local entrepreneurs. The project combines an intuitive online store interface with advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to provide customers with exceptional shopping experiences.

The platform allows for browsing products, managing a shopping cart and wishlist, as well as interacting with an intelligent shopping assistant who helps in selecting appropriate items.

## 🚀 How it works?

The application consists of two main modules: the user interface (Frontend) and the data management server (Backend).

### Main Features:

*   **🏪 Product Browsing:** Dynamic product grid with filtering by categories, types, and price sorting.
*   **🤖 AI Assistant (Gemini):** Integrated chat with the Google Gemini language model, which advises customers and answers questions about the assortment.
*   **🛒 Cart & Shopping:** Full handling of the purchasing process, adding to cart, managing quantity, and calculating totals.
*   **❤️ Wishlist:** Ability to save favorite products for later.
*   **👤 User Account:** Registration and login system (with data validation) and user profile.
*   **📱 Responsiveness:** Modern design ("Local Business") adapted to various devices.
